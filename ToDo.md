potential improvements:
- ui / ux
    - desktop: use space more efficiently (next to each other and smaller width)
    - remember position when going back - redux?
    - pagination: add first, last, numbers with dots in between

    - images: show only one and allow switching with arrow
    - stats: find out max values and use bars for visualization
    - moves:
        - group editions with same moves
        - split into type: machine, egg, train, ...
    - evolutions:
        - use images
        - link to respective pokemon
        - highlight current

- structure
    - use HATEOAS urls more + structure better
    - use redux
    - improve types definitions
    - rethink component structure (reduce LOC per comp. e.g.: PokeDetails)
